# Car-Accident-Project Proposal

Team: Charlene Gray, Nida Hussain, Varun Athreya, Christine Mazur and Sathya Ruchirantha

Topic:  Our team will present a website for users to drill down on a chosen geographic area and visualize car accident data along with weather conditions at the time of the accident on a map. 

  ● The user will choose a US state or city from several dropdown lists to narrow the location to be shown on a map.  The map will detail       that location’s car accidents with severity denoted by bubble size layering.
  
  ● The map will visually show how weather affects car accidents by denoting a symbol for each weather type, such as rain, snowflakes, etc. 

Please read the 'Final Presentation' powerpoint slide deck for project details.

To run the flask choose app.py or the run_win.bat file.
